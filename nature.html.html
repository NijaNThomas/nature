<p class="intro-sub">Bamboo is the most important species and introduced in large scale 
    especially sociel forestry in India.It is a best substitute for hardwoods and adsorbs carbondoixide gases and 
    release 35% more oxygen to the atmosphere that is equivalent to hardwood trees.In socal forestry programmes bamboo
    is grown in the following systems.<p class="intro-sub">Bamboo is important step towords the development of sustainable  utilization
        and renewable resource.There are about 1500 bamboo spiecies in the world.It is the world faster producer for 
        biomass and can be used for anything between production of paper or clothing used for construction. In China,
        bamboo leaf extract has a long history of food and medical applicationsand have a potential to get remarkable
        relevance among spectator in global market. Bamboo shoots is an important food source in many Asian 
        countries with Thailand,China and Japan is the biggest consumers.

    <ol style="color:white;font-size:20px;">
     <li>Strip plantation</li><br>
        <p class="intro-sub">The plantation along canal,roads,agricultural fields ,protection of community etc.And also 
            offer physical protection of the land resources ,in that they not only conserve topography 
            ,soil,water,air and fertility,aso provide shade and clean surrounding.It also meets the immediate requirments
            like agricultural population small timber,fuel and fodder.
        </p>
        <li >Rehabilition of degraded forest</li><br>
        <p class="intro-sub" >The report show that total forest area of country is 75 million hectors.The recent satellite imagery shows the dense
            forest occupies  an area of 37.8 million hectors.The remaining area got degraded forset where the density of trees are less
            than 40% of dense forest.Bamboo has planted on large scale in several states in order to rehabitate  dense forest by 
            degraded forest program with an aim to improve soil fertility and thereby productivity. 

        </p>
        <li >Reclamation of waste lands</li><br>
        <p class="intro-sub">This means re-claiming it or use this land for prductive purpose .Wasteland reclamation is the process of
    turning barren ,sterile waste land to fertile land which is suitable for cultivation and habitation. 
    The land which is suffer various problems like soil erosion,acidity,gully,ravine,landslide,water logging,acidity
    etc.Government of India implement programme for reclamation of land to improve soil condition ,selection of proper 
tree species for afforestation and re-vegetation of land is the key way of success in these programmes. Bamboo is appropriate 
which can be planted on these lands.This species being tolerant of water logging,salinity,alkalinity,soil erosion etc.

 </p>
        <li >Agroforestry plantation</li><br>
        <p class="intro-sub"> Bamboo is a household species and is best friend  of farmers.
            It is a system by which agricultural  crops can be grown in association with tree crops.Any agro forestry 
            take in concern we can see that there is a competition for light, space water and nutrients between the tree crop And 
            agricultural crop.So the tree crop is selected should be compatible to the agricultural crop.
        </p>
        <li >Community forestry programmes</li><br>
        <p class="intro-sub">This programme is based on growing bamboo on public community
            land contrary to private farms.The department of forest take most of the programmes and take responsibility 
            about planting.The involvment of local community is passive and normally restrictred to the provision
            of hired labour for planting and an agreement to  protect plantation.
        </p>
    </ol>
</list>
It is highly versatile and capable to growing in different type of soil . We can use bamboo for home decoration and domestic purpose.Moreover this products are eco-friendly and sustainable.</p>

<p class="intro-sub">Building with bamboo looks back on ancient traditioon in the regions there the growth of plants
    are enormous such as South America ,Africa band particlarly in South-East-Asia. 
    It is the oldest construction materials and is used for walls ,roofs ,foundation , reinforcements and decorations.
    It acts as good earthquake resistance material. The world is facing scarcity about timber consumption in future.Due to urbanisation the people need more
     timbers. They decided to choose a product which is best substitution wide
    range of purpose. A product which doesn't have negative or no impact to environment.The greate advantage of bamboo 
    is that we can utilize all the parts of the plant for a variety of 
    purposes ranging from construction to deodrants and medicines.
    Bamboos are fast growing plants in the world,due to rhizome-dependent system. Certain species can grow 910 mm within
    a 24-hour period,at a rate of almost 40 mm an hour(a growth around 1mm every 90 seconds,or 1 inch every 40 minutes ).
     Bamboo is a pioneering plant it can grown in full sun and tolerates high winds.This is capable of land reclamation
     damaged by overgrazing or poor farming.

 <p class="intro-sub">Bamboo is the definite solution for nature,cultivation and maintenance of bamboo is easy in comparison
     with wood.It grows faster and dense foilage ,will deposite a thick layer of leaf litter covering the ground,and will then
     start restoring degraded soils and re-establishing a cooler micro-climate.Bamboo roots are fibrous 
     and spread
     widely.This means that it has the ablity to hold soil and excellent solution for soil erosion. Bamboo has the 
     capacity  for very high nitrogen uptake.This makes mitigation of waste water pollution and disposal of effluents.
     Waste water from manufacturing ,livestock farming and seweage treatment plants can be used to irrigate bamboo crops,thus covering
     the waste water into useful biomass.

 <table class="intro-sub">
     <ul class="intro-sub">
         <li>Moisture content of bamboo</li>
         <p>  Bamboo is a <i>hygroscopic </i>material that is it will absorb or expel moisture from or to it's surroundings
             untill an equilibrium is reached. Moisture content in bamboo varies according to the properties of surrounding air. Water is held in 
             two ways ,free water which is retained in cell cavities,and bound water which is in cell walls themselves.The moisture 
             content of the clum wall is higher than inner portion compare to outer portion.
             Bamboo shrinks more than wood.Nodes are very vulnerable during shrinking.It shrinkage 10 to 15% of cross section</p>
         <li class="intro-sub">Tensile strength</li>
         <p class="intro-sub">   Tensile strength can be be defined as the resistance offered 
             by an objecting to breaking or splitting under
             tension.Bamboo and steel are structural materials which is used for construction.The comparative 
             strength of bamboo is higher than steel.Steel had a tensile strength of 23,000 pounds per square inch .Bamboo has a tensile
             strength of 28,000 pounds per square inch. Bamboo has been used in the construction field for long time ,even 
             before the tensile strength was known. People used to build houses ,furniture ,fences ,etc.with bamboo. Researchers and 
             engineers are looking forward to replacing steel with bamboo 
             due to tensile properties.The use of concrete is costly and cause environmental impact like atmospheric 
             pollution and environmental degradation.
               The fibers of bamboo run axially,outer zone constitute of highly tensile strength .The tensile 
             stength of these fibers is higher than steel ,but to construct connects which can transfer
              load axially impossible.</p>
         <li >Fire resistance</li>
         <p class="intro-sub">  Due to the presence of high silicate acid it act as a good resistance towards fire.
             it is filled up with water ,it can stand a temperature of 400 &#8451 while the water cooks inside.
         </p>
         <li >Elasticity</li>
         <p class="intro-sub"> Bending elasticity module for a typical bamboo species varies in the range of
             8.945 to 11.691 MPa the lowest value for green bamboo and  the highest value for dry bamboo. Enormous elasticity is very good for building material in earthquake prone zones.It is light weight ,easy transportation
            and work easily,the use of cranes are not inevitable.

            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;" class="intro-sub">
            <li>
                Modulus of Elasticity
            </li></ol>
        </table>
        <p class="intro-sub">The distrbution of fibers increases from inside to outside.The E-modulus of cellulose is 70,000 N/mm&sup2; and 
            about 50% of the cross-section of the fiber is cellulose and it's E-modulus is 35,000 N/mm&sup2; .The density of the fiber in the cross-section of a bamboo 
            shell various along its thickness.This presents a functionally gradient material ,evolved according to the "stress distribution" in it natural
            environment.
